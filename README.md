# Hi, I'm Harish 👋

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a hands-on data scientist and former solution architect who is passionate about building intelligent systems using AI, NLP, and automation. I enjoy working on projects that turn real-world messiness into structured, actionable insights, whether that's scraping product data, extracting text from PDFS, or matching resumes to job roles with semantic search.
